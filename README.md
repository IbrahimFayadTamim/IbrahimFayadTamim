## 📘 Project Overview
This project was completed on the **Let'sDefend** blue-team simulation platform as part of the ITECH1502 Cybersecurity Fundamentals course.  
The selected scenario, **Phishing Email Investigation**, involved analysing a suspicious email allegedly sent by PayPal in German.  
The task was to determine whether the email was malicious, identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and apply containment actions following real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) procedures.

Through this investigation, I practiced safe analysis of email headers, URLs, and attachments using sandboxing, SIEM and EDR correlation tools provided in Let'sDefend.  
This hands-on exercise demonstrates my ability to identify phishing attacks, analyse malicious indicators, and document results using standard cybersecurity methodologies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Confirm whether the suspicious email was malicious.  
- Identify and document Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).  
- Analyse headers, links, and attachments using sandboxing and reputation tools.  
- Correlate host and network logs in SIEM/EDR modules.  
- Contain and mitigate the incident, documenting all actions.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Used
- **Let'sDefend Platform:** Email investigation, SIEM, and EDR dashboards.  
- **VirusTotal:** URL and file reputation checks.  
- **urlscan.io:** Visual inspection of phishing URLs.  
- **Sandbox (Let'sDefend):** Behavioural malware analysis.  
- **NIST CSF Framework:** Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover.  
- **GitHub:** For evidence documentation and portfolio development.

## 💡 Reflection
This project improved my understanding of phishing detection and SOC workflows.  
It reinforced practical skills in:
- Analysing email headers and URLs safely.  
- Interpreting sandbox, SIEM, and EDR data.  
- Documenting incident response steps using real-world frameworks.  

I also learned the importance of automating repetitive tasks, such as SIEM queries, and capturing forensic images before remediation.
